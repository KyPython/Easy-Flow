## Email Body Template

```markdown
Hi [CLIENT_NAME],

Thanks for booking time with us! I'm excited to show you how EasyFlow can eliminate [SPECIFIC_PAIN_POINT] at [COMPANY_NAME].

Based on our conversation, you're currently spending around [TIME_SAVED_PER_MONTH] hours per month on manual workflows. For a [COMPANY_SIZE] team, that's roughly $[MONTHLY_COST_OF_PROBLEM] in wasted productivity every month. Let's fix that.

---

## What This Costs (And Why It Pays for Itself in Week 1)

| Item | Cost | What You Get |
|------|------|--------------|
| **Setup Fee** | $197 one-time | Custom workflow build for [SPECIFIC_PAIN_POINT] + integrations (Google Drive, Slack, [relevant tools]) + training session + 30-day optimization support |
| **Monthly** | $29/month | Unlimited workflow runs, monitoring, updates, and same-day support |

**ROI Example:** If we save you just [TIME_SAVED_PER_MONTH] hours/month (conservative estimate), you break even in the first week. Everything after that is pure productivity gain.

[Customize this ROI section based on their specific numbers – use their hourly rate x time saved]

## Customization Notes for Sales Team

### Before Sending, Customize These Sections:

1. **Subject Line:** Use Option 1 if you know their specific pain point. Use Option 2 for generic/first calls.

2. **Opening Paragraph:** Replace `[SPECIFIC_PAIN_POINT]` with THEIR language:
   - ❌ "manual data entry" (generic)
   - ✅ "copying client info from 5 spreadsheets into Asana every Monday" (specific)

3. **ROI Calculation:**
   - Use their actual numbers from discovery
   - Formula: `(Hours Saved × Their Hourly Rate) - $226 (first month cost) = Net Savings`
   - Example: "(20 hours × $50/hr) - $226 = $774 saved in month 1"

4. **What You Get (Setup Fee):**
   - List their actual integrations (not generic ones)
   - Reference their use case specifically

5. **Call Agenda – Section 2:**
   - Replace `[SPECIFIC_PAIN_POINT]` with their workflow
   - Example: "your client onboarding process" or "your weekly reporting nightmare"

6. **What to Prepare:**
   - Add or remove checklist items based on their tech stack
   - If they mentioned specific tools, list them by name

7. **P.S. Section:**
   - Link to relevant case study or demo if available
   - OR remove entirely if no relevant example exists

## Email Variations by Prospect Type

### For Small Teams (2-10 people)
**Emphasize:**
- Speed to setup (3-5 days)
- Low monthly cost vs. hiring
- "Set it and forget it" reliability

**Subject:** `Save [TIME_SAVED] Hours/Week Without Hiring – [DATE] Call`

### For Mid-Size Teams (10-50 people)
**Emphasize:**
- ROI multiplied across team
- Integration with existing tools
- Scalability as they grow

**Subject:** `Let's Automate [SPECIFIC_PAIN_POINT] for Your [COMPANY_SIZE] Team – [DATE]`

### For Agencies/Service Businesses
**Emphasize:**
- Client-facing benefits (faster turnaround)
- Consistency/quality control
- Competitive advantage

**Subject:** `Onboard Clients in 60 Seconds Instead of 3 Days – [DATE] Call`

---

## Timing Guide for Different Time Zones

When scheduling, always confirm THEIR timezone:

```
"Our call is [CALL_DATE] at [CALL_TIME] YOUR TIME (that's [YOUR_TIME] for me)."
```

Use: `9am PST / 12pm EST / 5pm GMT` format if multiple stakeholders.

---

## Red Flags to Watch For (Adjust Template If You See These)

❌ **They haven't described their workflow in detail yet**  
→ Send discovery questions email FIRST, then this template

❌ **They're comparing you to Zapier/Make**  
→ Emphasize custom builds vs. DIY, add case study comparison

❌ **They want to "think about it"**  
→ Shorten call to 30 min, remove pricing table, focus on demo only

❌ **Budget concerns**  
→ Emphasize ROI harder, offer payment plan: "$197 setup + first month free trial"

---

## Follow-Up Sequence (If No Response)

**+24 hours:** Slack/text reminder (if you have their #)  
**+48 hours:** "Still on for [DATE]?" email (1 sentence)  
**+72 hours:** "Should we reschedule?" with Calendly link  
**+1 week:** Final "Closing the loop" email (offer alternative resource)

---

## Success Metrics

Track these after each email sent:
- **Open rate:** Target 70%+ (use personalized subject lines)
- **Response rate:** Target 60%+ (strong CTA + urgency)
- **Show-up rate:** Target 80%+ (reminder + clear value prop)

If any metric is low, A/B test:
- Subject lines
- Call length (try 30 min vs 60 min)
- Pricing visibility (show vs hide until call)

---

## Quick Copy-Paste Snippets

### ROI Calculator (Paste into body):
```
Quick math:
• You save: [TIME_SAVED] hours/month
• Your time is worth: ~$[HOURLY_RATE]/hour
• Monthly savings: $[TIME_SAVED × HOURLY_RATE]
• EasyFlow cost: $29/month after setup
• Net gain: $[SAVINGS - 29]/month

That's $[ANNUAL_SAVINGS] back in your pocket this year.
```

### Urgency Booster (Add to closing):
```
P.S. – We currently have 3 open onboarding slots this month. If you want to 
launch before [END_OF_MONTH], let's use one of them for [COMPANY_NAME].
```

### Social Proof (Add after pricing table):
```
**Recent wins:**
• [Similar Company] cut their client onboarding from 4 hours to 8 minutes
• [Similar Company] eliminated 15 hours/week of spreadsheet updates
• [Similar Company] reduced onboarding errors by 94%

[Link to case study if available]

**Subject:** Let's Build Your Client Onboarding Automation – Thursday Jan 16 at 2pm EST

Hi Sarah,

Thanks for booking time with us! I'm excited to show you how EasyFlow can eliminate manual client onboarding at Acme Marketing.

Based on our conversation, you're currently spending around 20 hours per month setting up new clients across Drive, Asana, and Slack. For a 15-person team, that's roughly $2,000 in wasted productivity every month (and that's not counting the errors or follow-up emails). Let's fix that.

---

## What This Costs (And Why It Pays for Itself in Week 1)

| Item | Cost | What You Get |
|------|------|--------------|
| **Setup Fee** | $197 one-time | Custom client onboarding workflow + Google Drive, Asana, Slack integrations + your welcome email templates + training for your team + 30 days of optimization |
| **Monthly** | $29/month | Unlimited client onboards, real-time monitoring, updates as you scale, same-day support |

**ROI Example:** You're onboarding ~8 clients/month. That's 20 hours saved × $100/hr (your account manager rate) = $2,000/month. Minus the $29 fee, you're netting $1,971/month. First month ROI (after setup): $1,774.

I'll build your automation live in EasyFlow so you can see how it works: form submit → Drive folder created → Asana project added → Slack invite sent → welcome email delivered. All in 60 seconds.

**4. Next Steps & Timeline (15 min)**  
If it's a fit, we agree on a launch date (usually 3-5 days). If not, I'll tell you honestly and suggest alternatives.

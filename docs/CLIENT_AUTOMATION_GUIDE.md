# Client Automation Guide - Flat Fee Services

**How to help people automate using EasyFlow (it's easy, but some need help getting started)**

---

## 🎯 Reframed Strategy: "Activation & Complex Workflows"

**Key Insight**: EasyFlow is designed to be easy - users can build workflows with natural language. But some people need:
1. **Help getting started** (first workflow to see how easy it is)
2. **Complex/custom automations** (beyond what the AI Agent can handle)
3. **Integration setup** (API keys, OAuth, etc.)

---

## 🎯 Two Revenue Streams (Updated)

### 1. "Concierge Onboarding" (Primary - Warm Leads)
**Goal**: Help users build their FIRST workflow so they see how easy EasyFlow is
- Target: Your 23 inactive signups
- Offer: "I'll help you build your first automation in 15 minutes"
- Price: $97 one-time setup
- Outcome: They see how easy it is, then build the rest themselves

### 2. "Complex Automation Service" (Secondary - When Needed)
**Goal**: Handle complex workflows that require technical knowledge
- Custom integrations
- Multi-step workflows with conditional logic
- API setup and configuration
- Price: $150–$500 based on complexity

---

## 📋 Step-by-Step Process

### Step 1: Find Opportunities

**Upwork Search Strategy:**
- Search: `"Zapier"`, `"Data Entry"`, `"Lead List"`, `"PDF to Excel"`
- Filter: Entry Level, Fixed Price ($50–$300)
- Action: Send 2 proposals per day

**Reddit Search Strategy:**
- Subreddits: `r/slavelabour`, `r/forhire`
- Search: `[TASK]` or `[HIRING]`
- Action: DM 3 people per day

**LinkedIn/Existing Users:**
- Target: Your 23 existing signups
- Action: Personal outreach for "Concierge Onboarding"

---

### Step 2: Use Outreach Templates

#### 🔵 Option A: "Concierge Onboarding" (Primary - Existing Users)

**For the 23 inactive signups - Help them get started:**

```
Hey [Name],

I noticed you signed up for EasyFlow but haven't built your first automation yet.

EasyFlow is designed to be super easy - you can build workflows with just natural language. But sometimes it helps to see it work once.

I'm opening 3 slots for "Concierge Onboarding" this week. I'll help you build your first automation in a 15-minute call, then you'll see how easy it is to build the rest yourself.

One-time $97 to get you started. Want to schedule a quick call?

[Your Name]
```

**Key Message**: "I'll help you get started, then you can build the rest yourself"

#### 🔴 Option B: "Complex Automation" (When They Need Technical Help)

**For complex workflows that need technical knowledge:**

```
Hey [Name],

Saw you're trying to automate [Complex Task]. EasyFlow can handle this, but it might need some custom setup (API keys, OAuth, etc.).

I can help you set this up:
- Configure integrations
- Build the workflow structure
- Test and document it
- Show you how to modify it yourself later

One-time $[X] setup. After that, you can modify it yourself in EasyFlow.

[Your Name]
```

**Key Message**: "I'll handle the complex setup, then you can modify it yourself"

---

### Step 3: Build WITH the Client (Not FOR Them)

**The EasyFlow Way - Show them how easy it is:**

1. **15-Minute Onboarding Call:**
   - Ask: "What's one task you do manually that you'd like to automate?"
   - Use EasyFlow's AI Agent: "Build me a workflow that [their task]"
   - Watch the AI Agent create it in real-time
   - Show them: "See? That's how easy it is!"

2. **Let Them Build It:**
   - Guide them through using the AI Agent
   - Help them refine the workflow
   - Show them how to modify it later

3. **For Complex Workflows:**
   - Only build manually if it requires:
     - Custom API integrations
     - Complex conditional logic
     - OAuth setup
   - Otherwise, let the AI Agent do it!

**Key Principle**: Don't build FOR them - show them how to build it themselves

---

### Step 4: Deliver & Get Paid

**Delivery Process:**
1. Build the automation
2. Test it works
3. Create demo video
4. Share access with client
5. Invoice for flat fee

**Payment:**
- Use Stripe (integrated in EasyFlow)
- Or invoice separately
- Get paid before/after delivery (your choice)

---

# IMMEDIATE ACTIONS (Today)

## Morning Sequence (10 minutes - DO THIS NOW)

### Step 1: Metrics Check (3 min)

```
TODAY'S DASHBOARD:
+─ New signups yesterday: [CHECK SUPABASE]
+─ Active users (30-day): [CHECK SUPABASE]
+─ Current MRR: $[CHECK STRIPE]
+─ Days to quarterly goal: [CALCULATE]

QUICK ANALYSIS:
- Is any number moving wrong direction?
- If yes, note it for today's priority
```

**Action:** Set up metrics dashboard in Supabase/Stripe

---

### Step 2: Competitive Intelligence (2 min)

**Today (Friday):** Review notes from the week - what pattern emerged?

**Action:** Check r/zapier, r/nocode for pain points

**Insight to note:** [What did users complain about this week?]

---

### Step 3: Today's #1 Priority (5 min)

```
TODAY'S #1: DEPLOY VERIFIED FEATURES TO PRODUCTION

This connects to quarterly goal because: 
- Delivers immediate value to users
- Generates data to inform integration roadmap
- Reduces context switching (pain point #3)

If I don't do this today, the consequence is:
- Ready features sit unused
- Users don't get value we already created
- Team loses momentum
```

**Rockefeller Principles Applied:** 
- Habit #1 (#1 Priority)
- Principle #1 (Ruthless Efficiency - 0 hours to deploy)

---

## Evening Sequence (5 minutes - End of workday)

```
DATE: December 27, 2025

 Did I complete today's #1 priority? [FILL AFTER DEPLOYMENT]

TODAY'S WIN:
[What worked? - Fill after deployment]

TODAY'S LESSON:
[What did I learn? - Fill after deployment]

EFFICIENCY IMPROVEMENT SPOTTED:
[What friction did I notice?]

TOMORROW'S #1:

### This Week's Strategy (15 min)

**1. EFFICIENCY FOCUS:**
"What's our biggest bottleneck this week?"
Answer: [DEPLOYMENT PROCESS - Need to streamline]

"What one step can I remove from the funnel?"
Answer: [MANUAL DEPLOYMENT CHECKS - Automate monitoring]

**2. DATA FOCUS:**
"What is the data screaming at me?"
Answer: [NEED PRODUCTION USER DATA - Deploy to get it]

"What metric needs urgent attention?"
Answer: [USER ENGAGEMENT WITH NEW FEATURES]

**3. COMPETITIVE FOCUS:**
"What did competitors do that I learned from this week?"
Answer: [CHECK MONDAY MORNING]

**4. THIS WEEK'S #1 PRIORITY:**

```
PRIORITY: Deploy verified features and monitor for 48 hours

SUCCESS LOOKS LIKE: 
- Features live in production
- No critical errors in first 48 hours
- User engagement metrics collected

HOW IT SUPPORTS QUARTERLY GOAL: 
- Delivers value immediately
- Generates data for integration roadmap

IF I DON'T DO THIS: 
- Users wait for value we already created
- Integration roadmap based on assumptions, not data

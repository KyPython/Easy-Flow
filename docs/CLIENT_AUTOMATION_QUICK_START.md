# Client Automation Quick Start

**Help people get started with EasyFlow (it's easy, but some need help seeing how easy it is)**

---

## 🚀 Today's Action Plan

### Step 1: Reach Out to Existing Users (30 mins)

**Email/Message your 23 inactive signups:**
- Use [Concierge Onboarding Template](OUTREACH_TEMPLATES.md#-option-b-founder-offer-existing-users)
- Personalize each message
- Offer "15-minute onboarding call"
- Message: "I'll help you build your first workflow, then you'll see how easy it is"

### Step 2: Schedule Onboarding Calls (15 mins)

**When someone says yes:**

1. **Schedule 15-minute call**
   - Use Calendly or similar
   - Block 15 minutes (not hours!)

2. **During the call:**
   - Ask: "What's one task you do manually?"
   - Show them: Use EasyFlow's AI Agent
   - Say: "Build me a workflow that [their task]"
   - Watch the AI Agent create it
   - Show them: "See? That's how easy it is!"

3. **After the call:**
   - They now know how to use EasyFlow
   - They can build the rest themselves
   - Invoice for $97 (one-time onboarding)

### Step 3: Complex Workflows (Only When Needed)

**Only if they need technical setup:**
- Custom API integrations
- OAuth configuration
- Complex multi-step logic
- Then charge $150–$500 for setup

## 📋 Copy-Paste Ready Scripts

### For Existing Users (Primary - Concierge Onboarding)

```
Hey [Name],

I noticed you signed up for EasyFlow but haven't built your first automation yet.

EasyFlow is designed to be super easy - you can build workflows with just natural language. But sometimes it helps to see it work once.

I'm opening 3 slots for "Concierge Onboarding" this week. I'll help you build your first automation in a 15-minute call, then you'll see how easy it is to build the rest yourself.

One-time $97 to get you started. Want to schedule a quick call?

[Your Name]
```

**Key Message**: "I'll help you get started, then you can build the rest yourself"

### For Complex Workflows (When They Need Technical Help)

```
Hey [Name],

Saw you're trying to automate [Complex Task]. EasyFlow can handle this, but it might need some custom setup (API keys, OAuth, etc.).

I can help you set this up, then you can modify it yourself later.

One-time $[X] setup. After that, you own it and can change it yourself in EasyFlow.

[Your Name]
```

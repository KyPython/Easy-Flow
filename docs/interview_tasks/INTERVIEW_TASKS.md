**Interview Tasks**

Location: `interview_tasks/`

This folder contains short, self-contained IDE-style interview tasks for personal practice.

Sample task included:
- `interview_tasks/sample_task/` — 60-minute LRU Cache task with tests.

How to run the sample task tests from the repository root:

```bash
pytest interview_tasks/sample_task/tests/test_lru_cache.py -q
```

If you want additional tasks or a rubric/cheat-sheet, ask me to generate them and I will add them here.

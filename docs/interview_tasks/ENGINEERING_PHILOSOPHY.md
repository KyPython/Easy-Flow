**Engineering Philosophy: Problem-Solvers First**

Core idea
- The primary role of software engineers is to solve technical problems that deliver business value — not to be narrowly-specialized implementers.

Principles
- Business-first: Understand product and customer impact; prioritize work that moves key metrics.
- Problem-solving: Focus on high-leverage problems (the "big fish") rather than micro-optimizations (e.g., shaving 10ms).
- Outcomes over inputs: Fall in love with outputs (impact, reliability, user experience), not with particular tools or micro-details.
- Collaborative ownership: Make decisions collaboratively; engineers should propose and implement but not gatekeep product knowledge.
- AI-augmented work: Use AI to generate scaffolds, tests, and drafts — but always verify, simplify, and explain outputs.
- Inclusive engineering: Empower non-technical stakeholders to contribute; aim for clear, maintainable code and documentation.

Practical guidance
- Start with product context: ask "why does this matter for users/business?" before coding.
- Run, test, and measure early: prototypes should be validated with tests and quick measurements.
- Avoid premature micro-optimization: defer low-value tuning until evidence shows it's needed.
- Commit frequently with clear messages and rationale (include AI provenance when relevant).
- When using AI: include a one-line provenance entry in PRs/commits and summarize verification steps.

Interview relevance
- Design interview tasks and evaluation to prioritize problem-solving, tradeoff reasoning, pragmatic implementation, and AI judgement instead of trivia.

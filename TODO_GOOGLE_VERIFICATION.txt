 PENDING: Google OAuth Verification
=====================================

 Quick Reminder:
- DNS TXT record is already added (verified with dig command)
- Need to complete Google Search Console domain verification
- Then request branding re-verification

🔗 Quick Links:
- Google Search Console: https://search.google.com/search-console
- OAuth Consent Screen: https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials/consent

 What Works Now:
- OAuth flows work (users can connect integrations)
- App works in "Testing" mode (up to 100 test users)
- All integrations function normally

 What's Pending:
- Domain verification in Google Search Console
- Branding verification (after domain is verified)
- This will remove "unverified app" warning and allow public access

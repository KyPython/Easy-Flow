# 🎯 Today's Action Plan - December 27, 2025

## 🌅 Morning Sequence (10 minutes - DO THIS NOW)

### Step 1: Metrics Check (3 min)
```
TODAY'S DASHBOARD:
├─ New signups yesterday: [CHECK NOW]
├─ Active users (30-day): [CHECK NOW]
├─ Current MRR: $[CHECK NOW]
└─ Days to quarterly goal: [CALCULATE]

QUICK ANALYSIS:
- Any number moving wrong direction?
- Note for today's priority
```

### Step 2: Competitive Intelligence (2 min)
**Today (Friday):** Review notes from the week
- Check r/zapier for user complaints
- Check r/nocode for pain points
- Note ONE insight: [________________]

### Step 3: Today's #1 Priority (5 min)
```
TODAY'S #1: DEPLOY VERIFIED FEATURES TO PRODUCTION

This connects to quarterly goal because: 
Delivers immediate value, generates data for integration roadmap

If I don't do this today, the consequence is:
Ready features sit unused, users don't get value
```

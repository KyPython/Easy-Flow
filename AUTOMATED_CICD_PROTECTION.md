# 🚨 Automated CI/CD Protection - No Manual Configuration Needed

## ✅ Fully Automated - Zero Manual Steps

This CI/CD system is **100% automated** - no manual GitHub configuration required.

---

## 🔒 What Protects Production

### 1. Pre-Push Hook (`.husky/pre-push`)
**Blocks ALL direct pushes to `main` branch**
- ✅ Enforced locally on every developer machine
- ✅ Cannot be bypassed (runs before git push)
- ✅ Forces use of `npm run ship` workflow

### 2. Ship-to-Production Script (`scripts/ship-to-production.sh`)
**The ONLY way code reaches production**
- ✅ Runs full test suite
- ✅ Security scans
- ✅ Code validation (SRP, Dynamic, Theme, Logging)
- ✅ RAG knowledge validation
- ✅ Terraform validation
- ✅ Merges dev → main
- ✅ Final validation on main
- ✅ Pushes to main (triggers deployment)

### 3. GitHub Workflows (`.github/workflows/`)
**Run after push, block if configured**
- ✅ QA — core feature tests (blocks on failure)
- ✅ QA — Integration Tests (blocks on failure)
- ✅ Code Validation (blocks on failure)
- ✅ Terraform Validation (blocks on failure)

### 4. Branch Protection (Optional - via GitHub API)
**Additional server-side protection**
- Run: `npm run setup:protection`
- Configures GitHub branch protection via API
- Requires GitHub CLI (`gh`) and admin permissions

---

## 🚀 Setup (One-Time)

### Option 1: Full CI/CD Setup (Recommended)
```bash
npm run setup:cicd
```

This will:
- ✅ Set up branch protection (if GitHub CLI available)
- ✅ Verify pre-push hooks
- ✅ Verify all workflows
- ✅ Verify ship-to-production script

### Option 2: Just Branch Protection
```bash
npm run setup:protection
```

**Requirements:**
- GitHub CLI installed: `brew install gh`
- Authenticated: `gh auth login`
- Repository admin permissions

## 📋 How It Works

### Development Workflow

1. **Work on `dev` branch:**
   ```bash
   git checkout dev
   # Make changes
   git commit -m "feat: add feature"
   git push origin dev
   ```
   - ✅ Pre-push hook allows (light checks only)
   - ✅ Workflows run but are non-blocking

2. **Ship to Production:**
   ```bash
   npm run ship
   ```
   - ✅ Runs ALL validations
   - ✅ Merges dev → main
   - ✅ Pushes to main
   - ✅ Triggers production deployment

### What Happens If You Try to Push Directly to Main?

```bash
git checkout main
git commit -m "test"
git push origin main
```

**Result:**
```
❌ ERROR: Direct pushes to 'main' branch are BLOCKED for production safety

🔒 Production deployments must go through the proper workflow:
   1. Work on 'dev' branch
   2. Run: npm run ship
   3. The ship script will:
      - Run all tests and validations
      - Merge dev → main
      - Push to main (triggers production deployment)

💡 This prevents non-production-ready code from reaching users
```

**Push is REJECTED - code cannot reach production**

## ✅ Protection Layers

| Layer | Type | Blocks Direct Push? | Blocks Merge? |
|-------|------|---------------------|---------------|
| Pre-Push Hook | Local | ✅ YES | N/A |
| Ship Script | Local | ✅ YES (must use script) | N/A |
| GitHub Workflows | Remote | ❌ No (runs after) | ✅ YES (if branch protection enabled) |
| Branch Protection | Remote | ✅ YES | ✅ YES |

**Result: Non-production code CANNOT reach production**

---

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### "Pre-push hook not working"

```bash
# Reinstall husky hooks
npm run prepare
```

### "Branch protection setup failed"

This is optional - the pre-push hook already blocks direct pushes. Branch protection provides additional server-side protection but isn't required if you trust your team to use `npm run ship`.

### "Workflow failed but code was pushed"

Workflows run AFTER pushes. The pre-push hook and ship script prevent non-production code from being pushed in the first place.

## 📝 Summary

✅ **Zero manual configuration needed**
✅ **Pre-push hook blocks all direct pushes to main**
✅ **Ship script is the ONLY way to deploy**
✅ **All validations run before merge**
✅ **Non-production code CANNOT reach production**

**Just run: `npm run ship` when ready to deploy!**

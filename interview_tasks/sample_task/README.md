60-minute IDE Interview Task — LRU Cache

Goal
- Implement a production-quality `LRUCache` class with `get` and `put` methods.

Timebox
- 60 minutes total: 5–10m read the task and run tests; 35–40m implement; 10–15m explain tradeoffs and commit history.

Deliverables
- A branch with small, logical commits.
- Implementation in `lru_cache.py`.
- Unit tests in `tests/test_lru_cache.py` (already provided).
- A short PR description that includes any AI assistance used.

Guidance for candidates
- Run tests with `pytest -q` from the repository root.
- Keep commits focused and incremental.
- Add or update tests if you change behavior.
- Document any tradeoffs in your PR body.

Scoring focus
- Correctness, efficiency (expected O(1) `get`/`put`), clarity, tests, commit hygiene, and explanation of tradeoffs.

# Cursor AI Behavior Rules

## Documentation & File Creation
- **STOP** creating new markdown (.md) files for every single change... (etc)
- **ONLY** create or update documentation if: [1, 2, 3...]
- **MAINTENANCE**: Actively look for opportunities to delete or consolidate redundant MD files.

## Code Quality & Standards
- **STYLE**: Strictly adhere to existing code style.
- **THEMING**: Use BLUE brand color via design tokens.
- **OBSERVABILITY**: Integrate all logs into the centralized observability system. Use the app's logger/telemetry service.
- **SRP (CODE)**: Every function/method must have a single, clear purpose.

## Self-Evolution & Learning
- **DYNAMIC LEARNING**: The app must be architected to learn and improve over time. Every automation, workflow, and AI feature must include a mechanism for capturing feedback (e.g., success/failure rates, execution deltas, or user corrections).
- **DATA FEEDBACK LOOPS**: Ensure that execution data is stored or logged in a structured format that allows for future model fine-tuning or prompt optimization.
- **CI/CD VALIDATION**: Every PR must pass a "Learning Check" to ensure that new workflows include the necessary telemetry or hooks to contribute to the system's growth.

## Architectural Integrity
- **IMPACT ANALYSIS**: Evaluate side effects, dependency cycles, and state consistency.
- **HOLISTIC REVIEW**: Ensure the solution aligns with the long-term system design and "learning" goals.

## Hand-off & Independence
- **GUIDANCE/EMPOWERMENT**: Provide clear pointers and relevant MD file locations at the end of every response.

# Rules for AI Behavior

This file contains rules that the AI assistant (Gemini Code Assist) must follow when generating or modifying code for this project.

## SQL Generation

- **Golden Rule:** When writing or modifying any SQL query, you **MUST** reference the database schema defined in the project.
- **Schema File Path:** The canonical schema is located at `rpa-system/backend/db/schema.sql`. **(Please verify this path is correct)**.
- **SQL Dialect:** All generated SQL must be compatible with PostgreSQL 15, as defined in `docker-compose.yml`.
- **Safety:** Do not generate SQL that modifies the schema (e.g., `ALTER TABLE`, `CREATE TABLE`, `DROP TABLE`) unless explicitly asked to do so.

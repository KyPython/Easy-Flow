Rockefeller Principles — EasyFlow checklist

This document summarizes the Rockefeller Habits / Rockefeller principles the project should follow.

Key principles (summary):
- Priorities: keep a clear 3-5 year and 1-year priorities list in project documentation.
- Data: define and track a handful of key metrics (weekly/monthly) in `easyflow-metrics/`.
- Meeting rhythm: document meeting cadence and owners in `docs/WORKFLOW.md`.
- Accountability: assign single owners for major initiatives and list them in `ROCKEFELLER_COMPLIANCE_PROGRESS.md`.
- Continuous improvement: record experiments and outcomes in `easyflow-metrics/experiments.json` and `docs/refactor_tasks_from_radon.md`.

Use `templates/scripts/check-rockefeller-compliance.sh` to run a lightweight verification.

Remediation guidance:
- If `docs/WORKFLOW.md` is missing, add a short section describing the weekly/monthly meeting cadence, owners, and primary KPIs.
- If `ROCKEFELLER_COMPLIANCE_PROGRESS.md` is missing, create a simple table mapping initiatives → owner → status.
- If metrics scripts are missing, copy or create `easyflow-metrics/experiments.json` and at least one tracker (e.g., `activation_funnel_tracker.py`).

- **Solution**: Professional-grade automation with an intuitive interface that business users can actually use
- **Benefit**: Deploy powerful automations without hiring expensive consultants or dedicated IT teams

### 3. **Real Security, Not Security Theater**
*"Privacy-First Automation That Actually Protects You"*
